`MATS` is a hardware-oriented test environment intended for production testing in a manufacturing 
environment.  The `MATS` framework is a test template and test sequence executor which includes
an implementation for basic user input and feedback.

MATS could be considered an automated test framework which imposes a consistent work flow and
reduces the amount of mind share that you need to dedicate to developing automated device tests.
